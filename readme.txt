== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a Wishpond account set up already? =

No, you can create your free account through the plugin, or you can simply use the provided guest account

= Is the 14-day free trial shared with the other Wishpond plugins? =

When you sign up for a free trial with any wishpond plugins, the subscription and trial is shared among all your plugins.

When the trial expires you will begin a paid subscription period. If you do not wish to begin a paid subscription period, please cancel your pricing plan within the 14-days of free trial.

The [Facebook Ads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook-ads/ "Create Facebook Ads for your wordpress with one button") plugin doesn't require a subscription and therefore doesn't have a trial.

Yes, you can try it completely free for the first 14 days.

= How much does it cost to run a form? =

* You can run unlimited forms for FREE for the first 14 days
* Running forms is extremely cost effective. This plugin lets you use features that aren't available on any other plugin.
* You can learn more about our pricing [here](http://corp.wishpond.com/pricing-plans/ "Pricing")

= What kind of support do I get ? = d

Wishpond campaigns are extremely easy and fast to set up. If you ever need assistance, we are available to you through live chat, email, and phone support.

= Do I need to set up any wordpress configuration options for this plugin ?=
If you want to hostAll you need is to make sure that the Permalinks are set to "Post Name" or "Custom Structure". You would verify this in Settings->Permalinks.

= Where are Forms stored ? =
Your Forms are stored on Wishpond, so that you can add email automation, ad campaigns and other features to your Forms.

= How do I delete a Form ? =
After you create a Form, you can view it under "Forms". You will see a list of the Forms you've published to your wordpress platform. Under each entry in that list, you can find a "Manage" link, which will send you to that Form's page. In there, you can see a "Delete" link at the bottom of the page.

= What URL should I use when creating a Form ? =
When creating a Form you have to make sure you use the domain of the wordpress page you are on, followed by the path at which you want the Form to be hosted. So if my wordpress site is at "http://www.wishpond.com" (and I can see this in the address bar) and I want to host my Form on its own page at at "new-form-page", then I would use the following url "http://www.wishpond.com/new-form-page". This page shouldn't exist on wordpress, a new one will be created for you.

= What if my wordpress site is on a multisite installation ? =
If your wordpress site is hosted under a multi-site installation, then your wordpress path would be preceeded by your site's domain. For example, if your wordpress site is hosted at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/" then you can host a Form at "http://www.wishpond-hosting.org/my-site/form"

= Can I embed the Form on an existing page ? =
Yes, you can. When editing a Form, under "Choose where your form will appear", select "Embed on my Website or Blog", and then follow the instructions to get the Form embedded anywhere.

= I can't publish my Form, what's wrong ? =
When editing a Form you must make sure the URL you specify begins with the same domain name and protocol(http or https) as your wordpress site. In other words, if your wordpress site is hosted at "https://my-wordpress-site.com" you can't use "http://my-wordpress-site.com" (notice the difference between http:// and https://) and you can't use "https://www.my-wordpress-site.com" or any other variation.

= What are guest users ? =
If you want to try out the plugin, simply go in Forms->Settings and click on the checkbox right next to "Guest User", then click "Save Changes". This will automatically create a wishpond account for you, with a guest e-mail address, that you can change later.

= I have another question, what do I do? =

Contact us anytime! If you ever need a question, you can always email us at [support@wishpond.com](mailto://support@wishpond.com "Wishpond Support") or just use the live chat available to you directly through this plugin.
